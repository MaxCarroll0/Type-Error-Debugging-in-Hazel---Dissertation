## Broadly
*Create a formal tickbox/scheduling document for this to put in final dissertation*
Research Slicing, CMTT, Test Generation -- Take relevant points to Preparation
Draft general mechanism of slicing & searching -- Consider their formal semantics
Produce Implementation Plan


## Specifics
# Edits
Update Slicing references to reflect the actual chosen slicing inspirations (e.g. Haack rather than Tip probably)
Fix References: gradual typing for functional languages, capitalisation, Hazel lang & code etc.
Add Candidate Number
Reformat Figure locations, consider putting some in appendices.
Consider changing figure font sizes (currently quite small)
Specify Judgement types for elaboration, external lang typing: generic?
Add specific page numbers for specific citations (especially in books, e.g. TAPL and Practical Foundations)

# Additions
Variable substitution definition
Call by value semantics demonstration
Describe CMTT Hole substitution & refinement relationship (with box and letbox)
