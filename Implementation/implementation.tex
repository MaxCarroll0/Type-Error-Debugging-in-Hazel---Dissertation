\chapter{Implementation}\label{chap:Implementation}
This project was conducted in two major phases:

First, I constructed a core mathematical theory for \textit{type slicing} and \textit{cast slicing} formalising what these ideas actually were and considered the changes to the system presented by Seidel et al. for the \textit{type error witnesses search procedure} to work in Hazel.  

Then, I implemented the theories, making it suitable for implementation and extending it to the majority of the Hazel language. Further, suitable deviations from the theory were made upon critical evaluation and are detailed throughout.

\section{Type Slicing Theory}\label{sec:TypeSlicingTheory}
\textbf{Replace all occurrences of `typing context' with `typing assumptions' to avoid name clash with expression/program contexts.}

I develop \textit{type slicing} as a mechanism to aid programmers in understanding \textit{why} a term has a given type via static means. Three slicing mechanism have been devised with differing characteristics, all of which associate terms with their typing derivation to produce a \textit{expression typing slice}. 

The first two criteria attempt to give insight on the structure of the typing derivations, and hence how types are decided. While the third criterion gives a complete picture of the regions of code which, if changed, could cause a change in type of the whole expression.

\textbf{Make some brief arguments into why the first two criteria are still useful.}

\textbf{PLACE ALL IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS INSIDE DEFINITION ENVIRONMENTS}

\subsection{Expression Typing slices}
A \textit{expression typing slice} $\rho$, is a pair $\varsigma^\gamma$, consisting of an \textit{expression slice} $\varsigma$ and \textit{typing context slice} $\gamma$ which are calculated based on some typing \textit{criterion}\footnote{One of the three slicing mechanisms.} based on the typability of the slice $\varsigma$ under context $\gamma$. 

Intuitively, an expression slice is a Hazel external expression highlighting the sub-terms of relevance to the \textit{typing criterion}. For example if my criterion is to \textit{omit terms which are typed as} \code{Int}, then the following expressions highlights as:

\[\hlcmaths[yellow!30]{(\lambda x: \code{Int}.\ \lambda y : \code{Bool}.}\ x\hlcmaths[yellow!30]{)(}1\hlcmaths[yellow!30]{)}\]

Formally, I represent this by specifying which sub-terms are omitted in the highlighted expression. So, Replace each omitted sub-term with a \textit{gap}, notated $\gap$. This is the same definition of a slice as presented in \cite{FunctionalProgExplain}.\footnote{With their `holes' equating with my `gaps'. Different terminology used to distinguish with Hazel's holes} i.e. representing the above highlighting we get slice:
\[(\lambda x : \code{Int}.\ \lambda y : \code{Bool}.\ \gap)(\gap)\]


Additionally, it is useful to omit variable names. For this I introduce \textit{patterns} $p$ for variable bindings: 
\[p ::= \gap \mid x\]

This gives the following extended syntax of expression slices, $\varsigma$, extending \cref{fig:syntax}:
\[\varsigma ::= \gap \mid  c \mid x \mid \lambda p : \upsilon.\ \varsigma \mid \lambda x.\ \varsigma \mid \varsigma(\varsigma) \mid \hole^u \mid \hole[\varsigma]^u \mid \varsigma : \upsilon\]
Where $\upsilon$ are types, similarly with potential omitted sub-term gaps:
\[\upsilon ::= \gap \mid \dyn \mid b \mid \upsilon \to \upsilon\]
These slices are then allowed to be \textit{typed} by representing gaps $\gap$ by holes of fresh metavariables $\hole^u$ in \textit{expressions}, fresh variables in \textit{patterns}, and the dynamic type in \textit{types}, see \textbf{(fig APPENDIX)}. From here-on consider $\gap$ as interchangeable with a hole $\hole^u$ of fresh metavariable $u$ or the dynamic type.

We then have a \textit{precision} relation on expression slices, $\varsigma_1 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_2$ meaning $\varsigma_1$ is less or equally precise than $\varsigma_2$, that is $\varsigma_1$ matches $\varsigma_2$ structurally except that some subterms may be gaps, see \textbf{ref appendix}. For example, see this precision chain:
\[\gap \sqsubseteq\gap + \gap\sqsubseteq 1 + \gap \sqsubseteq 1 + 2\]
We have that $\sqsubseteq$ is a partial order (\textbf{cite}), that is, satisfies relexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity. Respectively:
\[\inference{}{\varsigma \sqsubseteq \varsigma} \quad \inference{\varsigma_1 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_2 & \varsigma_2 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_1}{\varsigma_1 = \varsigma_2} \quad \inference{\varsigma_1 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_2 & \varsigma_2 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_3}{\varsigma_1 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_3}\]
We also have a \textit{bottom} (least) element, $\gap \sqsubseteq \varsigma$ (for all $\varsigma$). This relation is trivially extended to include complete expressions $e$ which satisfy that: if $e \sqsubseteq \varsigma$ then $e = \varsigma$, i.e. complete terms are always \textit{unique} upper bounds of precision chains.

An expression slice $\varsigma$ \textit{of} $e$ is a slice such that $e \sqsubseteq e$.

\textit{Typing context slices} are simply a typing context $\Gamma$, which is used to represent the notion of \textit{relevant typing assumption}. Typing contexts are just functions mapping variables to types notated $x : \tau$ (see \cref{sec:TypingJudgements}). Functions are sets, so they also have a partial order of subset inclusion, $\subseteq$. Again, we have a bottom element, $\emptyset$.  These are notated $\gamma$ and if $\gamma \subseteq \Gamma$ then $\gamma$ is a slice \textit{of} $\Gamma$.

The precision relation and subset inclusion can be extended pointwise to give a partial order, $\sqsubseteq$, on expression typing slices:
\[[\varsigma_1\mid \gamma_1] \sqsubseteq [\varsigma_2\mid \gamma_2] \iff  \varsigma_1 \sqsubseteq \varsigma_2 \text{ and } \gamma_1 \subseteq \gamma_2\]

expression typing slices will often be grouped and indexed upon expressions and typing contexts, $P_e^{\Gamma}$ which contains all slices $\rho \sqsubseteq (e, \Gamma)$. So, the set $P_e^{\Gamma}$ forms a lattice (\textbf{cite}) with unique least upper bound $[e, \Gamma]$ and greatest lower bound $[\gap, \emptyset]$. Similarly, an element $\rho$ in $P_e^{\Gamma}$ can referred to as a expression typing slice \textit{of} $e$ under $\Gamma$.
\subsection{Context Slices}
\textbf{add pattern slices. }

\newcommand{\C}{\mathdcal{C}}
Formally, an \textit{expression context} $\mathdcal{C}$ is an expressions with \textit{exactly one} sub-term marked as $\cmark$:\footnote{The two separate syntax definition for application allow a \textit{mark} to be in either the left or right expression, but \textit{not both}.}
\[\C ::=  \cmark \mid \lambda x : \tau.\ \C \mid \lambda x.\ \C \mid \C(e) \mid e(\C) \mid \C : \tau\]

Where $\C\{e\}$ substitutes expression $e$ for the mark $\cmark$ in $\C$, the result of this is necessarily an expression. Additionally, contexts are composable: substituting a context into a context, $\C_1\{\C_2\}$ produces another valid context, notate this by $\C_1 \circ \C_2$\footnote{Context can alternatively be though of as functions from expressions to expressions.}.


\newcommand{\Cs}{\mathdcal{c}}
\newcommand{\p}{\mathdcal{p}}
Similarly to expressions, contexts can be extended to \textit{context slices} by allowing slices within:
\[\Cs ::= \cmark \mid \lambda p : \upsilon. \Cs \mid \Cs(\varsigma) \mid \varsigma(\C) \mid \Cs : \upsilon\]

However, the precision relation $\sqsubseteq$ is defined differently, requiring that the mark $\cmark$ must remain in the same position in the context structurally speaking. For example $\cmark(\gap) \sqsubseteq \cmark(1)$, but $\cmark \not \sqsubseteq \cmark(1)$. This can be concisely defined by \textit{extensionality} (\textbf{cite}):

\begin{definition}[Context Precision]\label{def:ContextPrecision}
If $\Cs'$ and $\Cs$ are context slices, then $\Cs' \sqsubseteq \Cs$ if and only if, for all expressions $e$, that $\Cs'\{e\} \sqsubseteq \Cs\{e\}$.
\end{definition}
Again, we refer to a context slice $\Cs$ of $\C$ as one satisfying that $\Cs' \sqsubseteq \C$.

We also get that filling contexts preserves the precision relations both on expression slices \textit{and} context slices:
\begin{conjecture}[Context Filling Preserves Precision]
For expression slice $\varsigma$ and context slice $\Cs$. Then if we have slices $\varsigma' \sqsubseteq \varsigma$, $\Cs' \sqsubseteq \Cs$ then also $\Cs'\{\varsigma'\} \sqsubseteq \Cs\{\varsigma\}$.
\end{conjecture}
Therefore, context slices $\Cs$ can be though of as monotone function (\textbf{cite})...

Show that composition is also preserved over precision, i.e. it is a functor.

\textit{Make some references to category theory, i.e. category of slices with morphisms being context slices. Or that slices form categories on expression $e$ and contexts are a functor between expression typing slice categories. i.e. contexts are monotonic functions}

\textbf{rewrite}
The accompanying notion of a \textit{typing co-context slice} is retained representing the notion of \textit{irrelevant typing assumptions}, those assumptions which would be used within portions of the context which were omitted. i.e. for a a term placed in the mark, we could type it using the original context minus the ones used only in typing the context.

This pair of context slice and typing assumptions slice is together referred to as a \textit{context slice} and notated $\p^\gamma$, should $\gamma$ be empty it may be omitted shorthand.

Extend composition to program contexts and substitution of expression typing slices. Again as slices are a superset of expressions, then this extends to expression etc.

When 

\subsection{Type-Indexed Slices}
For \textit{criteria 2 \& 3 and cast slicing}, there is a need to decompose slices to find sub-slices which contribute to specific portions of a compound type. For example, which part of the expression typing slice was related to the argument type of a function specifically.

\textbf{Give EXAMPLE}

A \textit{type(-indexed) slice} consists of: a expression typing slice, a context slice, and a \textit{type} \textit{index} $i$. This index is either an \textit{atomic} type label or is \textit{compound}, consisting of type slices conforming to the structure of types:
\[i ::= \dyn \mid b \mid s \to s\]
\[s ::= \p\{i \mid \rho\}\]
The type that a type slice $s$ \textit{represents} is the slice retaining only it's type labels. This will be notated by $\type{s}$, defined inductively:
\[\type{\p\{\dyn\mid \rho\}} = \dyn \quad \type{\p\{b \mid \rho\}} = b\]
\[\type{\p\{s_1 \to s_2 \mid \rho\}} = \type{s_1} \to \type{s_2}\]

A term $e$ in some context $\C$ will be associated with a \textit{type slice} with the meaning that $\rho$ contains a expression typing slice for typing $e$ and $\p$ contains a context slice for typing $e$ in context $\C$ according to some criterion. Typically the context slice would correspond to type analysis and the expression typing slice would correspond to type synthesis.

The compound type slices must satisfy the crucial property that the sub-terms are sub-\textit{slices} of $\rho$. That is:
\[\p\{\p_1\{i_1 \mid \rho_1\} \to \p_2\{i_2 \mid \rho_2\} \mid \rho\} \implies \p_1\{\rho_1\} \sqsubseteq \rho\text{ and }\p_2\{\rho_2\} \sqsubseteq \rho\]

The precision relation can be extended to slices pointwise upon the expression typing slice and context slice, and atomic types $a$ (i.e. $a ::= \dyn \mid b$):
\[\p'\{a' \mid \rho'\} \sqsubseteq \p\{a \mid \rho\} \iff \p' \sqsubseteq \p,\ \rho' \sqsubseteq \rho,\text{ and }a' \sqsubseteq a\]
And recursively for compound slices:\footnote{Note, function arguments are \textit{covariant} for this.}
\begin{align*}
\p'\{s_1' \to s_2' \mid \rho'\} \sqsubseteq \p\{s_1 \to s_2 \mid \rho\} \iff &\p' \sqsubseteq \p,\ \rho' \sqsubseteq \rho,\\
&s_1' \sqsubseteq s_1,\text{ and }s_2' \sqsubseteq s_2
\end{align*}

Composition of expression typing slices to the outer context is possible, $(\p' \circ \p)\{i \mid \rho\}$, and is notated shorthand as $\p'\{s\}$ for $s = \p\{i \mid \rho\}$.

Additionally, if $\p$ is empty, $\cmark^\emptyset$, a type slice may be notated without it: $i \mid \rho$. Equally, when $\rho$ is empty, $\gap^\emptyset$, then notate $\p'\{i\}$. This means that if both $\p, \rho$ are both empty then we have $i$ which is syntactically identical to types $\tau$, so we can trivially treat types as \textit{empty type slices}.  

Then function matching $\funmatch$ can be extended to slices in multiple different ways with different uses depending on the context, see the appendix \textbf{ref}.

\subsection{Criterion 1: Synthesis Slices}
\label{sec:SynthesisSlices}
For \textit{synthesis type slices} we consider an expression synthesising a type $\tau$ under some context $\Gamma$:
\[\synthesis{e}{\tau}\]
And consider the slices in $P_e^{\Gamma}$ and attempt to find the minimum slice $\rho = [\varsigma\mid \gamma]$ constraining that $\rho$ also synthesises the same type $\tau$ under the restricted context $\gamma$:
\[\synthesis[\gamma]{\varsigma}{\tau}\]
Where minimality requires that no other (strictly) less precise slice satisfies the criterion. That is: for any slice $\rho' = [\varsigma'\mid \gamma']$, if $\synthesis[\gamma']{\varsigma'}{\tau}$ and $\rho' \sqsubseteq \rho$, then $\rho' = \rho$.

\textbf{GIVE CONCRETE EXAMPLE HERE, use highlighting}

I conjecture that, under the Hazel type system, there exists a unique minimum slice for each $\synthesis{e}{\tau}$:\footnote{Would follow from uniqueness of typing derivations in Hazel.}
\begin{conjecture}[Uniqueness]\label{conj:SynthesisSliceUniqueness}
If $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are \textit{minimum synthesis slices} for $\synthesis{e}{\tau}$, then $\rho = \rho'$.
\end{conjecture}

These slices can be found by omitting portions of the program which are \textit{type checked}. If, $\analysis{e}{\tau}$, then by use of the subsumption rule we also have that $\analysis{\gap}{\tau}$:
\[\inference[Subsumption]{\synthesis{\gap}{\dyn} & \tau \sim \dyn}{\analysis{e}{\tau}}\] 
As the dynamic type is consistent with any type: $\dyn \sim \tau$.

Then, to find the \textit{minimum synthesis slice}, we can mimic the Hazel type synthesis rules (see \cref{fig:typing}), replacing uses of type analysis with gaps. Creating a judgement $\synthesisslice{e}{\tau}{\rho}$ meaning: \textit{$e$ that synthesises type $\tau$ under context $\Gamma$ produces minimum synthesis slice $\rho$}.

To demonstrate, the expression slice of a variable $x$ can only be either $x$, requiring the use of $x : \tau$ from the context:
\[
\inference[SVar]{x : \tau \in \Gamma & \tau \neq \dyn}{\synthesisslice{x}{\tau}{[x\mid x:\tau]}}\]
But if $x : \dyn$, then the (empty) slice $[\gap, \emptyset]$ also synthesises $\dyn$, so instead use this. 

For functions, we can recursively find the slice of the function body (which synthesises it's type in the original rules, hence having a minimum synthesis slice) and place inside a function. 
If the assumption $x : \tau_1$ was \textit{required} in synthesising that type, then this name must be present in the expression slice and the context slice no longer requires this assumption to type check the sliced function:
\[\inference[\tiny SFun]{\synthesisslice[\Gamma,x:\tau_1]{e}{\tau_2}{[\varsigma \mid \gamma, x : \tau_1]} }{\synthesisslice{\lambda x:\tau_1.\ e}{\tau_1 \to \tau_2}{[\lambda x : \tau_1.\ \varsigma \mid \gamma]}}\]
Otherwise, if $\gamma$ does not use variable $x$ then this binding may be omitted:
\[\inference[\tiny SFunConst]{\synthesisslice[\Gamma,x:\tau_1]{e}{\tau_2}{[\varsigma \mid \gamma]} & x \not \in \mathrm{dom}(\gamma)}{\synthesisslice{\lambda x:\tau_1.\ e}{\tau_1 \to \tau_2}{[\lambda \gap : \tau_1.\ \varsigma \mid \gamma]}}\]

For function applications we can simply omit the argument, while the slice for the function can be obtained as it synthesises it's type.
\[\inference[\tiny SApp]{\synthesisslice{e_1}{\tau_1}{[\varsigma_1 \mid \gamma_1]}}{\synthesis{e_1(e_2)}{\tau}{[\varsigma_1(\gap) \mid \gamma_1]}}\]
The remaining rules are in \cref{fig:SynthesisSlices}.

It is \textit{expected} \textbf{(Proof TODO)} that these rules do indeed always produce a slice for any expression which synthesises a type, and that this slice is minimal:
\begin{conjecture}[Correctness]
\label{conj:SynthesisSliceCorrectness}
If $\synthesis{e}{\tau}$ then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\synthesisslice{e}{\tau}{\rho}$ where $\rho = [\varsigma \mid \gamma]$ with $\synthesis[\gamma]{\varsigma}{\tau}$.
\item For any $\rho' = [\varsigma' \mid \gamma'] \sqsubseteq [e\mid \Gamma]$ such that $\synthesis[\gamma']{\varsigma'}{\tau}$ then $\rho \sqsubseteq \rho'$.
\end{itemize}
\end{conjecture}

\subsubsection{Extension to Type-Indexed Slices}
This mechanism can be trivially extended to type-indexed slices, where types being synthesised can be replaced by slices directly, i.e. \textit{slice synthesis}. See the appendix \textbf{ref AND FIX}.

\subsection{Criterion 2: Analysis Slices}\label{sec:AnalysisSlices}
\textbf{Try find the minimum slice of the below definition \textit{without} type indexed slices}

A similar idea can be devised for analysis slices. Essentially, we do the opposite of \textit{criterion 1} and omit sub-terms where \textit{synthesis} was used. The objective is to show \textit{why} a checked term is required to check against it's type.

The useful notion to represent these are \textit{context slices}. It is the terms immediately \textit{around} the sub-term where the type checking deconstructs a checking type:

For example, when checking this term against $\code{Bool} \to \code{Int}$:
\[(\lambda x. \hole^u)\]
The slice context of the inner hole term $\hole^u$, which is required to be consistent with \code{Int}, would be the following:
\[\hlcmaths[yellow!30]{(\lambda} x\hlcmaths[yellow!30]{.} \hole^u \hlcmaths[yellow!30]{)}\]
Intuitively, this means that the \textit{contextual} reason for $\hole^u$ to be required to be an \code{Int} is that it was within a function (and the context was initially checked against $\code{Bool} \to \code{Int}$ and deconstructed to retrieve the return type $\code{Int}$.

There are also subterms:
\[\hole^u : \code{Int} : \dyn : \code{Bool}\]


\begin{definition}[Analysis Slice]\label{def:analysisslice}
For a derivation $\analysis{e}{\tau}$ containing a sub-derivation $\analysis[\Gamma']{e'}{\tau'}$ in context $\C$, that is, $e = \C\{e'\}$. An \textit{analysis slice} of $e'$ is a \textit{context slice} $\p = [\Cs, \gamma]$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Cs$ is a slice of $\C$, that is, $\Cs \sqsubseteq \C$.
\item $\analysis{\Cs\{e'\}}{\tau}$ contains a sub-derivation for $\analysis[\Gamma'\backslash \gamma]{e'}{\tau}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The \textit{minimum analysis slice} is just the minimum under the precision ordering $\sqsubseteq$. And it must be unique:

\begin{conjecture}[Uniqueness]\label{conj:AnalysisSliceUniqueness}
If $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are \textit{minimum analysis slices} for sub-terms $e'$ of $e$ where $\analysis{e}{\tau}$, then $\rho = \rho'$.
\end{conjecture}

\textbf{...}

This formulation does indeed find the minimum such slice in the context:
\begin{conjecture}[Correctness]\label{conj:AnalysisSliceCorrectness}
If $\analysis{e}{\tau}$ and $e = \C\{e'\}$ such that $\analysis[\Gamma']{e}{\tau'}$ then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p$ ...
\item For any $\p' = [\Cs' \mid \gamma'] \sqsubseteq [\C\mid \Gamma]$ such that $\analysis{\Cs'\{e'\}}{\tau}$ and $\analysis[\Gamma'\backslash \gamma']{e'}{\tau'}$  then $\p \sqsubseteq \p'$.
\end{itemize}
\end{conjecture}

In the case of Hazel, it turns out that this minimum context slice is always just the least precise version of the input context and never requires typing assumptions, so $\gamma$ is empty. But, other language features may have more complex behaviour\footnote{Type functions, for example.} and formalising it this way helps build intuition for \textit{criterion 3} and it's extension in \textit{cast slicing}.

\subsubsection{Extension to Type-Indexed Slices}
Given that type analysis does not outputs types, the useful trivial extension that worked for \textit{synthesis slices} is not possible here.

However, if we instead check against \textit{type slices} then extension is possible. Further, it provides this method with more power, the input slices carry their own information in an extended context, and the resulting slices for subterms may reference this. 

For example, if the input slice was derived from an annotation, then a subterm checking against a sub-term of the slice will be able to output a slice highlighting \textit{only the relevant part} of the annotation. \textbf{SHOW}

\subsection{Criterion 3: \textit{good\_name\_here}}
Both the previous criterion only extracted information about one half of the typing rules, either synthesis or analysis.

This criterion aims to highlight all regions of code which \textit{contribute} to the given type (either synthesised or analysed). Where \textit{contribute} means that if the sub-term changed it's type, then the overall term would also, or would become ill-typed.

\textbf{Give example here}

Notice that, in any typing derivation the only sub-terms which \textit{can} be changed without causing the rule to no longer apply are those which the premises and conclusion are \textit{not} linked \textit{syntactically}. There is only one such rule: \textit{subsumption}. The only way a replacing a subterm with a new type could be valid is if the new type is 

Talk about annotations as analysis slices?

The objective of this criterion is to determine which parts of an expression required to be typed checked. Therefore, it omits the sub-terms which could be changed to a different type, but still have the whole expression check against the same type. 

\textbf{Give example here with highlighting.}

Formally, this criterion considers expressions $e$ type checked against a type $\tau$ under typing context $\Gamma$:
\[\analysis{e}{\tau}{\varsigma}\]
And finds the minimum slice of $e$ in this context such that 


Mention pattern slices.

\subsection{Join Types}\label{sec:JoinTypesTheory}
The Hazel core calculus is very primitive, only consisting of \textit{base types}, \textit{annotations}, and \textit{functions}. Extensions to gradual types \cite{GradualJoins}, and Hazel \cite{MarkedLocalisation}\footnote{Here as the \textit{meet} of the opposite of my \textit{precision} order.}: \textit{if} expressions, \textit{pattern matching}, \textit{sum types} etc. all require\footnote{Or are easiest formulated with.} \textit{join types}. 

A join of two types $\tau_1 \sqcup \tau_2$ (if one exists) is the least precise (most general) type that more precise than both $\tau_1, \tau_2$: that $\tau_1 \sqsubseteq \tau_1 \sqcup \tau_2$ and $\tau_1 \sqsubseteq \tau_1 \sqcup \tau_2$. Therefore, the join is therefore is consistent with both $\tau_1, \tau_2$. Type consistency can be reformulated in terms of joins: $\tau_1, \tau_2$ are consistent \textit{if and only if} they have a join. This is the \textit{order-theoretic} \textbf{(cite)} join with respect to the precision partial order on types. 
For example, the type of an \textit{if statement} would be the join of the types of it's branches.

These add an additional way to generate a \textit{new type} other than by synthesis or from annotations.\textit{ add some machinery to demonstrate how a expression typing slice could be constructed by taking the `deepest' branch in the join and working out if it was the left/right branch etc.}

Also has application in combining slices at subsumption (so each term has one slice, rather than some having two).

\section{Cast Slicing Theory}\label{sec:CastSlicingTheory}

Fairly trivial, just treat slices as types and decompose accordingly. The whole reason of indexing by type was to allow this.

The idea of it being a minimal expression typing slice producing the same cast doesn't really work here due to dynamics. Explore the maths of this. Either way, it is a useful construct in practice. Exploring this in more detail, looking at \textit{dynamic program slicing} could be a good future direction.

\subsection{Cast Dependence}
This in combination with the indexed slices could have some nice mathematical properties.

Though, these would need to retrieve information about parts of slices that were lost when decomposing slices. i.e. when a slice $\tau_1 \to \tau_2$ extracts the argument type $\tau_2$, the slicing criterions lose track of the original lambda binding. A way to reinsert these bindings such that we get a minimal term which \textit{Evaluates to the same cast} e.g. But this will have lots of technicalities with correctly tracking the restricted contexts $\gamma'$ for closures (i.e. functions returning functions which have been applied once). \textbf{TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE FURTHER DIRECTIONS SECTION.}
