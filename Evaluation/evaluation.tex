\textbf{Should I put proposed implementation plans and improvements here or in implementation??}

Evaluation Here.\par 
Evaluate small scope hypothesis for this problem. Note that small inputs don't necessarily correlate with small evaluation traces.

\section{Goals}\label{sec:EvaluationGoals}
i.e. Project Proposal. But make it with more clarity, i.e. `Most Type Errors Admit Witnesses'
Completeness etc. most of Hazel...

\section{Effectiveness Analysis}\label{sec:EffectivenessAnalysis}

\subsection{Search Procedure}
\subsubsection{Witness Coverage}
Describe reasons for failure in next section
\subsubsection{Code Coverage}
\subsubsection{Trace Size}
\subsubsection{Slice Size}
Does this correlate with trace size!

\subsection{Type Slicing}
\subsubsection{Correctness}
?
\subsubsection{Code Slice Size}
Compare with theory adhering slices and `simplified' slices.


\section{Performance Analysis}\label{sec:PerformanceAnalysis}
\subsection{Search Procedure}
\subsubsection{Time}
\subsubsection{Space}

\subsection{Slices}
\subsubsection{Space}
Compare with using using `Typ (turned off). Compare with old implementation (if possible)

\section{Critical Analysis}\label{sec:CriticalAnalysis}
\subsection{Analysis Type Slices}
Which constructs are ignored? Why, do they have the biggest impact on size?
\subsection{Categorising Programs Lacking Type Error Witnesses}
\subsubsection{Non-Termination}
The original procedure would get stuck on programs that loop forever. (To) Fix with iterative deepening
\subsubsection{Repeated Instantiations}
A hole being instantiated to a hole. Does this ever happen??
\subsubsection{Dead Code}
Search proc cannot reach, and failed cast detection would never find one there even if it existed (i.e. statically found).
\subsubsection{Dynamically Safe Code}
Code that is safe to run in all situations, but still exhibits a static type error.

\subsubsection{Needle in a Haystack}
Very specific input required from multiple hole instantiations. Combinatorial explosion makes this very hard to find (solve with coverage directed search, but this requires SMT solvers at least).

\subsection{Non-Local Errors}
Useful when type correct code written but used in the wrong way, i.e. write the wrong map function with @ still has a valid type. Especially prevalent with global inference.
\subsection{Bidirectional Type Error Localisation}
It is generally good. Find some cases where bidirectional type error localisation is wrong.
\subsection{Improving Hole Instantiation}
To improve code coverage. i.e. Strings and Floats are annoying, SMT solvers could be used...
\subsection{Combinatorial Explosion}
