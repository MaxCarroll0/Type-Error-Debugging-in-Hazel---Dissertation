Implementation:
- Analysis slices implementation differ from theory (full term context). They will omit highlighting the structure of binding constructs: I conjecture that, due to the deeply nested nature of let bindings and functions (vs lists and tuples, measure/confirm this?), that this is a good way to keep slices smaller.
- Context slices simply highlight the type slice in the context
- Add a slicing implementation fully using slices, i.e. tagging all regular types with empty slice. Meausure if this has a performance impact (probably little).
