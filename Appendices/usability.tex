\chapter{Unimplemented Usability Improvements \& Extensions}\label{sec:UIImprovements}
 Below are proposed improvements, which the architecture of both Hazel and the new features can easily support:

\begin{itemize}
\item Display type slices only \textit{upon request} using the Hazel context inspector, showing the \textit{analysing} and \textit{synthesising} types of the selected expression, see \cref{fig:ContextInspector}.
\item Allow users to deconstruct type slices to query specific parts, e.g. select the just the sub-slice explaining the \textit{return type} of a function or just the function arrow part. This could be done by selecting the type parts in the context inspector.
This interaction would help users really understand how code comes together to define it's types.
\item Visualise graphs of cast dependencies, showing the \textit{execution} context leading to a cast error, summarising more concisely than full evaluation traces.
\item Provide a UI for the search procedure's execution traces and instantiations, integrated with Hazel's trace visualiser. This could include trace compression for better readability (e.g., skipping irrelevant function calls).
\item Implement key bindings to cycle through indeterminate evaluation paths more quickly.
\end{itemize}
