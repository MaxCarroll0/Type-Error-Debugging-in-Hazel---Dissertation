abstract = {Plotkin and Pretnar's handlers for algebraic effects occupy a sweet spot in the design space of abstractions for effectful computation. By separating effect signatures from their implementation, algebraic effects provide a high degree of modularity, allowing programmers to express effectful programs independently of the concrete interpretation of their effects. A handler is an interpretation of the effects of an algebraic computation. The handler abstraction adapts well to multiple settings: pure or impure, strict or lazy, static types or dynamic types. This is a position paper whose main aim is to popularise the handler abstraction. We give a gentle introduction to its use, a collection of illustrative examples, and a straightforward operational semantics. We describe our Haskell implementation of handlers in detail, outline the ideas behind our OCaml, SML, and Racket implementations, and present experimental results comparing handlers with existing code.},

abstract = {The last few years have seen a renewed interest in continuations for expressing advanced control structures in programming languages, and new models such as Abstract Continuations have been proposed to capture these dimensions. This article investigates an alternative formulation, exploiting the latent expressive power of the standard continuation-passing style (CPS) instead of introducing yet other new concepts. We build on a single foundation: abstracting control as a hierarchy of continuations, each one modeling a specific language feature as acting on nested evaluation contexts.We show how iterating the continuation-passing conversion allows us to specify a wide range of control behavior. For example, two conversions yield an abstraction of Prolog-style backtracking. A number of other constructs can likewise be expressed in this framework; each is defined independently of the others, but all are arranged in a hierarchy making any interactions between them explicit.This approach preserves all the traditional results about CPS, e.g., its evaluation order independence. Accordingly, our semantics is directly implementable in a call-by-value language such as Scheme or ML. Furthermore, because the control operators denote simple, typable lambda-terms in CPS, they themselves can be statically typed. Contrary to intuition, the iterated CPS transformation does not yield huge results: except where explicitly needed, all continuations beyond the first one disappear due to the extensionality principle (η-reduction).Besides presenting a new motivation for control operators, this paper also describes an improved conversion into applicative-order CPS. The conversion operates in one pass by performing all administrative reductions at translation time; interestingly, it can be expressed very concisely using the new control operators. The paper also presents some examples of nondeterministic programming in direct style.},

abstract = {Program slicing is a method used by experienced computer programmers for abstracting from programs. Starting from a subset of a program's behavior, slicing reduces that program to a minimal form which still produces that behavior. The reduced program, called a “slice”, is an independent program guaranteed to faithfully represent the original program within the domain of the specified subset of behavior.Finding a slice is in general unsolvable. A dataflow algorithm is presented for approximating slices when the behavior subset is specified as the values of a set of variables at a statement. Experimental evidence is presented that these slices are used by programmers during debugging. Experience with two automatic slicing tools is summarized. New measures of program complexity are suggested based on the organization of a program's slices.},

abstract = {A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.}

abstract = {Quick Check is a tool which aids the Haskell programmer in formulating and testing properties of programs. Properties are described as Haskell functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components, then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},

In this paper, we evaluate the small-scope hypothesis for answer-set programming (ASP). To this end, we follow work in traditional testing and base our evaluation on mutation analysis. In fact, we show that a rather limited scope is sufficient for testing ASP encodings from a representative set of benchmark problems. Our experimental evaluation facilitates effective methods for testing in ASP. Also, it gives some justification to analyse programs at the propositional level after grounding them over a small domain.},

abstract = {Garcia and Cimini study a type inference problem for the ITGL, an implicitly and gradually typed language with let-polymorphism, and develop a sound and complete inference algorithm for it. Soundness and completeness mean that, if the algorithm succeeds, the input term can be translated to a well-typed term of an explicitly typed blame calculus by cast insertion and vice versa. However, in general, there are many possible translations depending on how type variables that were left undecided by static type inference are instantiated with concrete static types. Worse, the translated terms may behave differently—some evaluate to values but others raise blame. In this paper, we propose and formalize a new blame calculus λBDTI that avoids such divergence as an intermediate language for the ITGL. A main idea is to allow a term to contain type variables (that have not been instantiated during static type inference) and defer instantiation of these type variables to run time. We introduce dynamic type inference (DTI) into the semantics of λBDTI so that type variables are instantiated along reduction. The DTI-based semantics not only avoids the divergence described above but also is sound and complete with respect to the semantics of fully instantiated terms in the following sense: if the evaluation of a term succeeds (i.e., terminates with a value) in the DTI-based semantics, then there is a fully instantiated version of the term that also succeeds in the explicitly typed blame calculus and vice versa. Finally, we prove the gradual guarantee, which is an important correctness criterion of a gradually typed language, for the ITGL.},

Since its introduction in functional languages, it has been adapted to a variety of type systems, including object-oriented, security, and substructural. This work studies its application to implicitly typed languages based on type inference. Siek and Vachharajani designed a gradual type inference system and algorithm that infers gradual types but still rejects ill-typed static programs. However, the type system requires local reasoning about type substitutions, an imperative inference algorithm, and a subtle correctness statement.This paper introduces a new approach to gradual type inference, driven by the principle that gradual inference should only produce static types. We present a static implicitly typed language, its gradual counterpart, and a type inference procedure. The gradual system types the same programs as Siek and Vachharajani, but has a modular structure amenable to extension. The language admits let-polymorphism, and its dynamics are defined by translation to the Polymorphic Blame Calculus.The principal types produced by our initial type system mask the distinction between static parametric polymorphism and polymorphism that can be attributed to gradual typing. To expose this difference, we distinguish static type parameters from gradual type parameters and reinterpret gradual type consistency accordingly. The resulting extension enables programs to be interpreted using either the polymorphic or monomorphic Blame Calculi.},

abstract = {Debugging is an inevitable activity in most software projects, often difficult and more time-consuming than expected, giving it the nickname the "dirty little secret of computer science." Surprisingly, we have little knowledge on how software engineers debug software problems in the real world, whether they use dedicated debugging tools, and how knowledgeable they are about debugging. This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as "printf debugging" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.},

abstract = {Providing better supports for debugging type errors has been an active research area in the last three decades. Numerous approaches from different perspectives have been developed. Most approaches work well under certain conditions only, for example, when type errors are caused by single leaves and when type annotations are correct. However, the research community is still unaware of which conditions hold in practice and what the real debugging situations look like. We address this problem with a study of 3 program data sets, which were written in different years, using different compilers, and were of diverse sizes. They include more than 55,000 programs, among which more than 2,700 are ill typed. We investigated all the ill-typed programs, and our results indicate that current error debugging support is far from sufficient in practice since only about 35\% of all type errors were caused by single leaves. In addition, type annotations cannot always be trusted in error debuggers since about 30\% of the time type errors were caused by wrong type annotations. Our study also provides many insights about the debugging behaviors of students in functional programming, which could be exploited for developing more effective error debuggers.},

abstract = {Girard and Reynolds independently invented System F (a.k.a. the second-order polymorphically typed lambda calculus) to handle problems in logic and computer programming language design, respectively. Viewing F in the Curry style, which associates types with untyped lambda terms, raises the questions of typability and type checking. Typability asks for a term whether there exists some type it can be given. Type checking asks, for a particular term and type, whether the term can be given that type. The decidability of these problems has been settled for restrictions and extensions of F and related systems and complexity lower-bounds have been determined for typability in F, but this report is the first to resolve whether these problems are decidable for System F. This report proves that type checking in F is undecidable, by a reduction from semi-unification, and that typability in F is undecidable, by a reduction from type checking. Because there is an easy reduction from typability to type checking, the two problems are equivalent. The reduction from type checking to typability uses a novel method of constructing lambda terms that simulate arbitrarily chosen type environments. All of the results also hold for the λI-calculus.}

abstract = {Statically-typed programming languages allow earlier error checking, better enforcement of disciplined programming styles, and generation of more efficient object code than languages where all type-consistency checks are performed at runtime. However, even in statically-type languages, there is often the need to deal with data whose type cannot be known at compile time. To handle such situations safely, we propose to add a type Dynamic whose values are pairs of a value v and a type tag T where v has the type denoted by T. Instances of Dynamic are built with an explicit tagging construct and inspected with a type-safe typecase construct.This paper is an exploration of the syntax, operational semantics, and denotational semantics of a simple language with the type Dynamic. We give examples of how dynamically-typed values might be used in programming. Then we discuss an operational semantics for our language and obtain a soundness theorem. We present two formulations of the denotational semantics of this language and relate them to the operational semantics. Finally, we consider the implications of polymorphism and some implementation issues.},

abstract = {Assertions play an important role in the construction of robust software. Their use in programming languages dates back to the 1970s. Eiffel, an object-oriented programming language, wholeheartedly adopted assertions and developed the "Design by Contract" philosophy. Indeed, the entire object-oriented community recognizes the value of assertion-based contracts on methods.In contrast, languages with higher-order functions do not support assertion-based contracts. Because predicates on functions are, in general, undecidable, specifying such predicates appears to be meaningless. Instead, the functional languages community developed type systems that statically approximate interesting predicates.In this paper, we show how to support higher-order function contracts in a theoretically well-founded and practically viable manner. Specifically, we introduce λcon, a typed lambda calculus with assertions for higher-order functions. The calculus models the assertion monitoring system that we employ in DrScheme. We establish basic properties of the model (type soundness, etc.) and illustrate the usefulness of contract checking with examples from DrScheme's code base.We believe that the development of an assertion system for higher-order functions serves two purposes. On one hand, the system has strong practical potential because existing type systems simply cannot express many assertions that programmers would like to state. On the other hand, an inspection of a large base of invariants may provide inspiration for the direction of practical future type system research.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a small but useful generalisation to the 'derivative' operation on datatypes underlying Huet's notion of 'zipper', giving a concrete representation to one-hole contexts in data which is undergoing transformation. This operator, 'dissection', turns a container-like functor into a bifunctor representing a one-hole context in which elements to the left of the hole are distinguished in type from elements to its right.I present dissection here as a generic program, albeit for polynomial functors only. The notion is certainly applicable more widely, but here I prefer to concentrate on its diverse applications. For a start, map-like operations over the functor and fold-like operations over the recursive data structure it induces can be expressed by tail recursion alone. Further, the derivative is readily recovered from the dissection. Indeed, it is the dissection structure which delivers Huet's operations for navigating zippers.The original motivation for dissection was to define 'division', capturing the notion of leftmost hole, canonically distinguishing values with no elements from those with at least one. Division gives rise to an isomorphism corresponding to the remainder theorem in algebra. By way of a larger example, division and dissection are exploited to give a relatively efficient generic algorithm for abstracting all occurrences of one term from another in a first-order syntax. The source code for the paper is available online and compiles with recent extensions to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.},

abstract = {Several modern programming systems, including GHC Haskell, Agda, Idris, and Hazel, support typed holes. Assigning static and, to varying degree, dynamic meaning to programs with holes allows program editors and other tools to offer meaningful feedback and assistance throughout editing, i.e. in a live manner. Prior work, however, has considered only holes appearing in expressions and types. This paper considers, from type theoretic and logical first principles, the problem of typed pattern holes. We confront two main difficulties, (1) statically reasoning about exhaustiveness and irredundancy when patterns are not fully known, and (2) live evaluation of expressions containing both pattern and expression holes. In both cases, this requires reasoning conservatively about all possible hole fillings. We develop a typed lambda calculus, Peanut, where reasoning about exhaustiveness and redundancy is mapped to the problem of deriving first order entailments. We equip Peanut with an operational semantics in the style of Hazelnut Live that allows us to evaluate around holes in both expressions and patterns. We mechanize the metatheory of Peanut in Agda and formalize a procedure capable of deciding the necessary entailments. Finally, we scale up and implement these mechanisms within Hazel, a programming environment for a dialect of Elm that automatically inserts holes during editing to provide static and dynamic feedback to the programmer in a maximally live manner, i.e. for every possible editor state. Hazel is the first maximally live environment for a general-purpose functional language.},

abstract="The so-called `typed tagless final' approach of [6] has collected and polished a number of techniques for representing typed higher-order languages in a typed metalanguage, along with type-preserving interpretation, compilation and partial evaluation. The approach is an alternative to the traditional, or `initial' encoding of an object language as a (generalized) algebraic data type. Both approaches permit multiple interpretations of an expression, to evaluate it, pretty-print, etc. The final encoding represents all and only typed object terms without resorting to generalized algebraic data types, dependent or other fancy types. The final encoding lets us add new language forms and interpretations without breaking the existing terms and interpreters.",

abstract="Should special features for exception handling, backtracking, or pattern matching be included in a programming language? This paper presents a method whereby some programs that use these features can be re-written in a functional language with lazy evaluation, without the use of any special features. This method may be of use for practicing functional programmers; in addition, it provides further evidence of the power of lazy evaluation. The method itself is straightforward: each term that may raise an exception or backtrack is replaced by a term that returns a list of values. In the special case of pattern matching without backtracking, the method can be applied even if lazy evaluation is not present. The method should be suitable for applications such as theorem proving using tacticals, as in ML/LCF.",

abstract = {The narrowing relation over terms constitutes the basis of the most important operational semantics of languages that integrate functional and logic programming paradigms. It also plays an important role in the definition of some algorithms of unification modulo equational theories that are defined by confluent term rewriting systems. Due to the inefficiency of simple narrowing, many refined narrowing strategies have been proposed in the last decade. This paper presents a new narrowing strategy that is optimal in several respects. For this purpose, we propose a notion of a needed narrowing step that, for inductively sequential rewrite systems, extends the Huet and L\'{e}vy notion of a needed reduction step. We define a strategy, based on this notion, that computes only needed  narrowing steps. Our strategy is sound and complete for a large class of rewrite systems, is optimal with respect to the cost measure that counts the number of distinct steps of a derivation, computes only incomparable and disjoint unifiers, and is efficiently implemented by unification.},

In sketching, the programmer uses partial programs to describe the desired implementation <em>strategy</em> , and leaves the low-level details of the implementation to an automated synthesis procedure. This paper describes the sketching approach to program synthesis, including the details of the <Emphasis Type="SmallCaps">Sketch</Emphasis> language and synthesizer. The paper will then describe some of the techniques that make synthesis from sketches possible, and will close with a brief discussion of open problems in programmer guided synthesis.},

The first one occurs in the typing module where unification is now necessary for solving polymorphic constraints over types. The second one consists in extending triggers' definition in order to deal with both term and type variables. Last, the matching module must be modified to account for the instantiation of type variables. We hope that this experience is convincing enough to raise interest for polymorphism in the SMT community.},

isbn = {0262017156},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
abstract = {In Software Abstractions Daniel Jackson introduces an approach to software design that draws on traditional formal methods but exploits automated tools to find flaws as early as possible. This approach--which Jackson calls "lightweight formal methods" or "agile modeling"--takes from formal specification the idea of a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core of simple and robust concepts but replaces conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a fully automated analysis that gives designers immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a language that captures the essence of software abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions. This revised edition updates the text, examples, and appendixes to be fully compatible with the latest version of Alloy (Alloy 4). The designer can use automated analysis not only to correct errors but also to make models that are more precise and elegant. This approach, Jackson says, can rescue designers from "the tarpit of implementation technologies" and return them to thinking deeply about underlying concepts. Software Abstractions introduces the key elements: a logic, which provides the building blocks of the language; a language, which adds a small amount of syntax to the logic for structuring descriptions; and an analysis, a form of constraint solving that offers both simulation (generating sample states and executions) and checking (finding counterexamples to claimed properties).}

abstract = {Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program’s authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the past four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.},
