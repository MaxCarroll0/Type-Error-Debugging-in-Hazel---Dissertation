abstract = {A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.}

Properties are described as Haskell functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components, then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},

abstract = {Garcia and Cimini study a type inference problem for the ITGL, an implicitly and gradually typed language with let-polymorphism, and develop a sound and complete inference algorithm for it. Soundness and completeness mean that, if the algorithm succeeds, the input term can be translated to a well-typed term of an explicitly typed blame calculus by cast insertion and vice versa. However, in general, there are many possible translations depending on how type variables that were left undecided by static type inference are instantiated with concrete static types. Worse, the translated terms may behave differently—some evaluate to values but others raise blame. In this paper, we propose and formalize a new blame calculus λBDTI that avoids such divergence as an intermediate language for the ITGL. A main idea is to allow a term to contain type variables (that have not been instantiated during static type inference) and defer instantiation of these type variables to run time. We introduce dynamic type inference (DTI) into the semantics of λBDTI so that type variables are instantiated along reduction. The DTI-based semantics not only avoids the divergence described above but also is sound and complete with respect to the semantics of fully instantiated terms in the following sense: if the evaluation of a term succeeds (i.e., terminates with a value) in the DTI-based semantics, then there is a fully instantiated version of the term that also succeeds in the explicitly typed blame calculus and vice versa. Finally, we prove the gradual guarantee, which is an important correctness criterion of a gradually typed language, for the ITGL.},

abstract = {Gradual typing is a discipline for integrating dynamic checking into a static type system. Since its introduction in functional languages, it has been adapted to a variety of type systems, including object-oriented, security, and substructural. This work studies its application to implicitly typed languages based on type inference. Siek and Vachharajani designed a gradual type inference system and algorithm that infers gradual types but still rejects ill-typed static programs. However, the type system requires local reasoning about type substitutions, an imperative inference algorithm, and a subtle correctness statement.This paper introduces a new approach to gradual type inference, driven by the principle that gradual inference should only produce static types. We present a static implicitly typed language, its gradual counterpart, and a type inference procedure. The gradual system types the same programs as Siek and Vachharajani, but has a modular structure amenable to extension. The language admits let-polymorphism, and its dynamics are defined by translation to the Polymorphic Blame Calculus.The principal types produced by our initial type system mask the distinction between static parametric polymorphism and polymorphism that can be attributed to gradual typing. To expose this difference, we distinguish static type parameters from gradual type parameters and reinterpret gradual type consistency accordingly. The resulting extension enables programs to be interpreted using either the polymorphic or monomorphic Blame Calculi.},

abstract = {Algebraic effect handlers offer an alternative to monads to incorporate effects in Haskell. In recent work Xie _et al._ show how to give semantics to effect handlers in terms of plain polymorphic lambda calculus through _evidence translation_. Besides giving precise semantics, this translation also allows for potentially more efficient implementations. Here we present the first implementation of this technique as a library for effect handlers in Haskell. We show how the design naturally leads to a concise effect interface and how evidence translation enables evaluating _tail resumptive_ operations _in-place_. We give detailed benchmark results where our library performs well with respect to other approaches.},

abstract = {Debugging is an inevitable activity in most software projects, often difficult and more time-consuming than expected, giving it the nickname the "dirty little secret of computer science." Surprisingly, we have little knowledge on how software engineers debug software problems in the real world, whether they use dedicated debugging tools, and how knowledgeable they are about debugging. This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WatchDog 2.0. To clarify the insights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular debugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as "printf debugging" remains a feasible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers.},

abstract = {Providing better supports for debugging type errors has been an active research area in the last three decades. Numerous approaches from different perspectives have been developed. Most approaches work well under certain conditions only, for example, when type errors are caused by single leaves and when type annotations are correct. However, the research community is still unaware of which conditions hold in practice and what the real debugging situations look like. We address this problem with a study of 3 program data sets, which were written in different years, using different compilers, and were of diverse sizes. They include more than 55,000 programs, among which more than 2,700 are ill typed. We investigated all the ill-typed programs, and our results indicate that current error debugging support is far from sufficient in practice since only about 35\% of all type errors were caused by single leaves. In addition, type annotations cannot always be trusted in error debuggers since about 30\% of the time type errors were caused by wrong type annotations. Our study also provides many insights about the debugging behaviors of students in functional programming, which could be exploited for developing more effective error debuggers.},

abstract = {Girard and Reynolds independently invented System F (a.k.a. the second-order polymorphically typed lambda calculus) to handle problems in logic and computer programming language design, respectively. Viewing F in the Curry style, which associates types with untyped lambda terms, raises the questions of typability and type checking. Typability asks for a term whether there exists some type it can be given. Type checking asks, for a particular term and type, whether the term can be given that type. The decidability of these problems has been settled for restrictions and extensions of F and related systems and complexity lower-bounds have been determined for typability in F, but this report is the first to resolve whether these problems are decidable for System F. This report proves that type checking in F is undecidable, by a reduction from semi-unification, and that typability in F is undecidable, by a reduction from type checking. Because there is an easy reduction from typability to type checking, the two problems are equivalent. The reduction from type checking to typability uses a novel method of constructing lambda terms that simulate arbitrarily chosen type environments. All of the results also hold for the λI-calculus.}

abstract = {Statically-typed programming languages allow earlier error checking, better enforcement of disciplined programming styles, and generation of more efficient object code than languages where all type-consistency checks are performed at runtime. However, even in statically-type languages, there is often the need to deal with data whose type cannot be known at compile time. To handle such situations safely, we propose to add a type Dynamic whose values are pairs of a value v and a type tag T where v has the type denoted by T. Instances of Dynamic are built with an explicit tagging construct and inspected with a type-safe typecase construct.This paper is an exploration of the syntax, operational semantics, and denotational semantics of a simple language with the type Dynamic. We give examples of how dynamically-typed values might be used in programming. Then we discuss an operational semantics for our language and obtain a soundness theorem. We present two formulations of the denotational semantics of this language and relate them to the operational semantics. Finally, we consider the implications of polymorphism and some implementation issues.},
