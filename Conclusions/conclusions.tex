\section{Conclusion}
Conclusions Here.

\section{Further Directions}
Further directions here, referencing unsatisfactory results from Evaluation. Also various extensions.
\subsection{Extension to Full Hazel Language}

\subsection{Slicing}
\subsubsection{Proofs}
\subsubsection{User Studies}
Effectiveness gauge

\subsection{Search Procedure}
\subsubsection{Jump Trace Compression}
\subsubsection{Symbolic Execution \& SMT Solvers}
\subsubsection{Ad-Hoc Polymophism}
Not in Hazel, but the search procedure can't deal well with it
\subsubsection{Formal Semantics \& Proofs}
Was an uncompleted extension goal

\subsection{Let Polymorphism \& Global Inference}
\subsubsection{Constraint Slicing}
\subsubsection{Gradual Type Inference}
Miyazaki
\subsubsection{Localisation}
Bidirectional typing localisation is good, but global inference is bad. The search procedure could improve localisation and also give more meaning to localisations.
